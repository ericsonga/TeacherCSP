This Book is for Teachers
==========================

This book is intended for teachers.  There is a companion book for students so please don't use this ebook with your students.  The ebook for students is available at http://runestoneinteractive.org.  We recommend creating your own course with the student ebook so that you can track the progress of your students.  We also recommend having your students create usernames and logging in so that if you have several students using the same computer their answers will be saved by their username.  

This chapter introduces the approach used in this book and offers some quick "teasers" of things we'll be doing later.  **Don't worry if you don't understand the code (programs - instructions that a computer can understand) that you see in this chapter**.  We'll go through things much more slowly in the next few chapters.  This book is intended for teachers who haven't programmed before.

This electronic book is different because it uses *examples plus practice*.  Most computer science books are about becoming professional software developers (people who write programs for a living).  Most computer science courses require you to write lots of code.  This book helps teachers learn how to *teach programming* without making you write lots of code.  It will use the programming language **Python** which is used by companies like Google and Pixar.

- Rather than have you write lots of code, we will ask you to *read* a lot of code *examples*, because that's what computer science teachers do most often.
- We ask you to *use* what you are learning from the examples in some simple *practice* exercises.  These exercises are meant to be short and easy, to fit into a teacher's busy life.
- As a teacher, you need to know what students most often *get wrong*, where you can find *resources* to help you teach, and *how* to teach different ideas.  The book is sprinkled with |teachernote| **Teacher Notes** that explain how to be an effective computer science teacher.
- **You don't have to install anything**.  You will read, edit, and run programs all from within the pages of this ebook inside the browser.
